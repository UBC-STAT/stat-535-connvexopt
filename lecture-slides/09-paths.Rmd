Constant companion

$$
\min_x \quad f(x) + \lambda  \textrm{pen}(x)
$$

* Standard type of problem in statistics.

* Why? $f$ is likelihood, $\textrm{pen}$ encodes "prior".

* In fact, Bayesian methods (on the log-scale) are exactly this

* Priors encode structure: sparsity, shrinkage, etc.

* Dantzig selector, Lasso, Ridge, Matrix decomposition, Glasso, Sparse PCA/CCA, Convex Clustering, ELnet, Group lasso, etc.

## Problem

$$
\min_x \quad f(x) + \lambda  \textrm{pen}(x)
$$


* We have applied our techniques to this problem

* But always for $\lambda=\lambda_0$

--

**THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN STATISTICS!!**

--

We do not know, a priori, what $\lambda_0$ we want (balance bias and variance).

We use CV, AIC, BIC, etc to choose $\lambda^*$, after we solved the problem for all $\lambda \in \{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_K\}$.


**Today:** We solve for a bunch of $\lambda$ at once.

---

## Goals

$$
\min_x \quad f(x) + \lambda  \textrm{pen}(x)
$$


1. Which $\{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_K\}$ do we use?

2. What $x_0$ do we use?

3. If we have a solution at $\lambda_i$, can this help at $\lambda_j$?

--

**Methods:**

Use the Dual and KKT conditions to get some insights.

Insights work for many problems of this form, but we'll do them for Lasso.

This address all 3 points.

---

## Lesson 1.

$$
\min_\beta \quad \frac{1}{2n}\norm{y-X\beta}_2^2 + \lambda \norm{\beta}_1
$$

* KKT: a solution $\hat\beta$ must satisfy $\Rightarrow \frac{1}{n}\left| X^\top_j(y-X\hat{\beta}) \right| \leq \lambda$ for all $j$.

* Strict inequality means $\hat\beta_j = 0$.

* Suppose $\hat\beta = 0$, how big must $\lambda$ be?

--

* We need $\frac{1}{n}\left| X^\top_j y \right| \leq \lambda$ for all $j$

* So we take $\lambda_{\max} = \frac{1}{n}\norm{X^\top y}_\infty$.

--

Appearance of $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$ is not a coincidence.

---

**Lesson 1** actually solved 2 problems

It says 

1. start at $\beta_0 = 0$ and 

2. start at $\lambda=\lambda_{\max} = \norm{X^\top y}_\infty$

What comes next requires some more tricks to get to `glmnet`

But LARS algorithm uses this.

--

Suppose $j$ gives $\lambda_{\max}$ and all other coefs are zero until $\lambda = \lambda_{\max} - \delta$.

Now, KKT: $-X_j^\top(y-X_j\beta_j) = \lambda \Longrightarrow \beta_j = (\lambda + X_j^\top y) / X_j^\top X_j$

This says: "until I get to $\lambda_{\max} - \delta$, $\beta_j$ is linear in $\lambda$"

--

From here, new variables are added, but similar arguments hold.

This is called a **Path algorithm** and it is exact. It solves for a whole range of $\lambda$, not a set of $\lambda$ values.

But it only works in certain cases, and it's not that fast.

---

## Lesson 2.



```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(100*200), 100)
y <- x %*% c(rep(5,15), rep(0,185)) + rnorm(100)
lambda_max <- max(abs(t(y) %*% x)) / 100
df <- tibble(lambda = seq(lambda_max, lambda_max * 1e-4, length.out = 1000))
lasso <- glmnet::glmnet(x, y, lambda = df$lambda)
df$one_norm <- apply(lasso$beta, 2, function(x) sum(abs(x)))
```

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(df, aes(lambda, one_norm)) +
  geom_point(color = blue) +
  theme_bw()
```

]

.pull-right[

* More action happens for small $\lambda$

* Typical to space the values on the **log** scale

* $\lambda_\max = \norm{y^\top X}_\infty$

* $\lambda_\min = \epsilon\lambda_\max$

* $\epsilon = \begin{cases} 0.01 & n < p\\ 0.0001 & p > n \end{cases}$

## Warm starts

1. So we start with $\lambda_1=\lambda_\max$ and $\hat\beta_{\lambda_1} = 0$. Suppose desired number of $\lambda$'s is $K$

2. Now for each $i > 1$, set $\lambda_{k} = \delta\lambda_{k-1}$ where $\delta = \lambda_\min^{1 / (K - 1)}$.

3. Initialize $\hat\beta_{\lambda_k} = \hat\beta_{\lambda_{k-1}}$

4. Run ISTA or FISTA or CD until convergence.

5. Go back to step 2 and repeat until we get to $\lambda_\min$.

--

Step 3 is called a "warm start". 

The differences between solutions at neighboring $\lambda$'s usually isn't that much, so we should be nearly there.

In many situations, `glmnet` can be faster to fit 100 values than to fit 1.

---

## Lesson 3.

Since we start with a bunch of 0's, can we tell if a bunch of solutions will still be 0?

The answer is yes.

**SAFE rule** ([El Ghaoui 2010](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2010/EECS-2010-126.html)) is a guarantee but a bit challenging to see:

$$|X_i^\top y| < \lambda - \norm{X_i}_2\norm{y}\left(\frac{\lambda_\max - \lambda}{\lambda_\max}\right) \Rightarrow \hat\beta_i = 0$$

--- 

Intuition: start with the dual, write $g(u) = \frac{1}{2n}\norm{y}_2^2 - \frac{1}{2n}\norm{y-u}_2^2$.



$$\textrm{Dual}\quad \max_u g(u) \quad\textrm{s.t.}\quad\norm{X^\top y}_\infty \leq \lambda$$

Take $u_0 = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_\max}y$. This is dual feasible. Then, $\gamma := g(u_0)$ is a lower bound for the dual optimum. 

$$\textrm{Equivalent}\quad \max_u g(u) \quad\textrm{s.t.}\quad\norm{X^\top y}_\infty \leq \lambda,\; g(u) \geq \gamma$$

---

Now consider a related problem.

$$m_i = \max_u |X_i^\top y| \quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad g(u) \geq \gamma$$

Now, if $m_i < \lambda$, then $\norm{X_i^\top y} < \lambda$ so $\hat\beta_i = 0$.

Solving the above problem gives

$$m_i = \norm{X_i}_2\sqrt{\norm{y}_2^2 - 2\gamma} + |X_i^\top y|.$$

Plugging in $\gamma$ gives the SAFE rule.

## Strong rule

The SAFE rule is a guarantee, but it often retains a lot of variables (that are actually 0 at the solution)

We know that at the solution, $\frac{1}{n}|X_j^\top(y-X\hat\beta_\lambda)| < \lambda \Rightarrow \hat\beta_{\lambda j}=0$

Try something: write $c_j(\lambda) := \frac{1}{n}X_j^\top(y-X\hat\beta_\lambda)$ (see [Tibshirani et al.](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/strong.pdf)).

**Assume** $c_j(\lambda)$ is 1-Lipschitz in $\lambda$: $|c_j(\lambda)-c_j(\lambda')| \leq |\lambda-\lambda'|$.

Now, if $|c_j(\lambda_{k-1})|<2\lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_k$, then
$$
\begin{aligned}
|c_j(\lambda_k)| &\leq |c_j(\lambda_k)-c_j(\lambda_{k-1})| + |c_j(\lambda_{k-1})|\\
&\leq \lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_k + 2\lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_k\\
&= \lambda_k\\
&\Rightarrow \hat\beta_j=0
\end{aligned}
$$

--

* Strong Rule: (1) assume 1-Lipschitz, (2) screen out coordinates with $|c_j(\lambda_{k-1})|<2\lambda_{k-1}-\lambda_k$, (3) do FISTA/CD on those we keep

* This was an assumption, so at the end of a loop, we check for violations with $|X_j^\top(y-X\hat\beta(\lambda_k))| \leq \lambda_k$

---

## Complete strategy (with CD)

1. Input $K$. 

2. Find $\lambda_\max$, calculate $\lambda_\min$. Set $\hat\beta = 0$.

3. For $k = 2,\ldots, K$.

    - Set $\hat\beta_k = \hat\beta_{k-1}$

    - Find the non-zero coordinates using the strong rule (the active set)
    
    - Run CD until convergence on only the active set.
    
    - Check the KKT condition for all coordinates. If any have $|X_j^\top (y- X\hat\beta_k)| > \lambda_k$, then add those to the active set and restart CD at the current solution.
