* Started at UBC this summer (moved in mid-March, 2 days before the border closed)
* Previously a Stats Prof at Indiana University for 8 years

* I've taught this material or parts of it 4 or 5 times before
* Much of my research uses optimization, though I never had a course on it

## About you

Assume working knowledge of/proficiency with:

* Real analysis, calculus, linear algebra

* Core problems in Machine Learning and Statistics 

* Programming (R, Python, Julia, your choice ...)

* Data structures, computational complexity
* Formal mathematical thinking

If you fall short on any one of these things, it’s certainly possible to catch up; but don’t hesitate to talk to me

## Why learn convex optimization?

.pull-left[
* Much of statistics relies on optimization

* In most courses you learn how to go from a concept

* ... to an optimization problem $P$

* This course is about **how to solve** $P$

* And why this is **a useful skill**

`r fa("arrow-down", fill = blue, height=100)`

.large[
$$P : \min_{\theta \in \Theta} f(\theta)$$
]]]


---

## Motivation


- Many software packages have built-in optimizers, 

- This is fine in certain cases (I have a function! Throw it in there.)

- often, others have already solved $P$

- Will work "fine" some of the time.

--

- Immensely suboptimal most of the time

--

### Why bother?

1. Different algorithms can sometimes be better or worse on .hand[your] problem.

2. Solving $P$ can improve your understanding of $P$

3. Solving $P$ may lead you to propose $Q$

---

## Questions to answer when optimizing

- Is it convex?
- Can you take analytic derivatives?
- Can you solve them for zero?
- Is the problem small, low dimensional?
- Do you need to solve it only once?
- Can you find the analytic Hessian?

Built-in optimizers are good if most of these answers are yes, or if they are all no.

In other cases, it's better to write custom code.

Knowing a little about optimization can reveal properties of the solutions.

---

## Example

Two ways to solve

$$\min_\beta \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-x_i^\top\beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|$$

```{r lasso-setup, echo=FALSE}
X = matrix(rnorm(1e6), 1000, 500)
y = X %*% c(1:20, rep(0,480)) + rnorm(1000)
```

.pull-left[
The LARS algorithm

```{r lars}
system.time(
  out1 <- lars::lars(X, y)
)
```
]


.pull-right[
The glmnet algorithm

```{r glmnet}
system.time(
  out1 <- glmnet::glmnet(X, y)
)
```
]

--

* That was a "small" problem, discrepancy gets much worse

* `lars` won't work if $p>n$

* But `lars` gives the **complete** path, `glmnet` doesn't

---

## Types of algorithms/problems

- General purpose (0th-order) e.g. Simulated Annealing, Nelder-Mead

- First order (Gradient descent, SGD, ADMM, Proximal methods)

- Second order (Newton, BFGS)

- Constrained/unconstrained?

- Linear/non-linear?

- Convex/Non-convex?

--

We're going to talk (mainly) about first-order methods for convex problems.

# Course mechanics

## Synchronous time

* Meet M/W

* I'm not going to record/post lectures, generally

* This is a small graduate class. I won't force it, but I prefer you keep your videos on.

* Try to "Raise a blue hand" and ask questions out loud rather than in the chat

--

.hand[If you don't know, no one else does either. Please ask.]

--

* About 50 minutes of lecture and 30 minutes of group activities (in break out rooms)


---

## Marks

.pull-left[
**In class activities**

* max 20 points (worth 1-4 each)

* Done in group, 1 submission

* honest effort gets full credit for all members

**Little Quiz**

* 10 points

* During class on the last Monday

* 30 minutes, all T/F or multiple choice
]

--

.pull-right[
**Individual homework (x2)**

* 15 points each

* 1 week to revise for 80% 

**Group project (your choice)**

* 35 points (5/25/5)

* presentation on last day
]

## Course communication

**Website:**

<https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-535-convexopt/>

* Hosted on Github.

* Links to slides and all materials

* syllabus is there. Be sure to read it.


**Slack:**

* Link to join on Canvas. This is our discussion board.

* Note that this data is hosted on servers outside of Canada. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy.


**Github organization**

* Linked from the website.

* This is where you complete/submit assignments/projects/in-class-work

* This is hosted by UBC <https://learning.github.ubc.ca/STAT-535A-201-2020W/>

---

## Why these?

* Yes, some data is hosted on servers in the US.

* But in the real world, no one uses Canvas/Piazza, so why not learn things they do use?

* Much easier to communicate, "grade" or comment on your work

* Much more DS friendly

* Note that MDS uses both of these, the department uses both, etc.

## Why version control?

.center[

![:scale 30%](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

]

* Much of this lecture is borrowed/stolen from Colin Rundel and Karl Broman

---

## Why version control?

* Simple formal system for tracking all changes to a project

* Time machine for your projects
    + Track blame and/or praise
    + Remove the fear of breaking things

* Learning curve is steep, but when you need it you REALLY need it

> Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don’t reply to emails.
> -- _Paul Wilson_

---

## Why Git

* You could use something like Box or Dropbox

* These are poor-man's version control

* Git is much more appropriate

* It works with large groups

* It's very fast

* It's much better at fixing mistakes

* Tech companies use it (so it's in your interest to have some experience)

> This will hurt, but what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.

---

## Overview

* `git` is a command line program that lives on your machine

* If you want to track changes in a directory, you type `git init`

* This creates a (hidden) directory called `.git`

* The `.git` directory contains a history of all changes made to "versioned" files

* This top directory is referred to as a "repository" or "repo"

* `github.com` is a service that hosts a repo  remotely and has other features: issues, project boards, pull requests, renders `.ipynb` & `.md`

* Some IDEs (pycharm, RStudio, VScode) have built in `git` (I don’t use this) 

* `git`/`github.com` is broad and complicated. Here, just what you **need**

---

## Typical workflow


.pull-left[
1. Download a repo from Github
```
git clone https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat-535-convexopt.git
```
2. Create a **branch**
```
git branch <branchname>
```
3. Make changes to your files.
4. Add your changes to be tracked ("stage" them)
```
git add <name/of/tracked/file>
```
5. Commit your changes
```
git commit -m "Some explanatory message"
```


**Repeat 3--5 as needed. Once you're satisfied**

* Push to Github
```
git push
```
]

]]


---
## What should be tracked?

**Definitely** code, markdown documentation, tex files, bash scripts/makefiles, ...

**Possibly** logs, jupyter notebooks, images (that won’t change), ...

**Questionable** processed data, static pdfs, ...

**Definitely not** full data, continually updated pdfs (other things compiled from source code), ...

---

## What things to track



* You decide what is "versioned". 

* A file called `.gitignore` tells `git` files or types to never track

```
# History files
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history

# Session Data files
.RData

# User-specific files
.Ruserdata
```

* Shortcut to track everything (use carefully):

```
git add .
```




---

## Rules

**In class work**
* Everyone shares a repo
* Each group makes a branch (with a creative name)
* Rename files that you clone.
* You push your changes and make a PR against `master`
* I review your work and merge the PR (I may ask for changes)

**Homework**
* You each have your own repo
* You make a branch
* No need to rename files
* You must make at **least 5 commits**
* Push your changes (at anytime) and make a PR against `master`
* I review your work and merge the PR (I may ask for changes)


**Project**
* Each team gets a repo.
* The `submission` branch is yours.
* Make other branches as you wish to divide up work
* When ready to submit, make a PR against `master`

---

## What's a PR?

* This exists on Github (not git)

* Demonstration

## Practice

.pull-left[

[Website](https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-535-convexopt/)

Do you have `git`?
```
git --version
```
If it's there, you're done.
